## Programming Project
In the landscape of modern media, newspapers play a pivotal role in shaping public opinion and discourse, particularly on critical issues like climate change. The COVID-19 pandemic, a time of unprecedented global change, may have potentially influenced how the media discusses such crucial topics. Based on the study by [Rauchfleisch et al.](https://doi.org/10.1080/17524032.2021.1990978), there's a suspicion that the pandemic diverted public attention away from climate change in Switzerland, as COVID-19 was considered a significantly more existential problem. This data analysis aims to delve into the heart of this phenomenon, focusing on the coverage of climate issues by the Swiss German-language press.

The goal my partner and I had set was to explore the evolution of climate-related attitudes in Swiss German-language newspapers during three different periods: pre-COVID, during COVID, and post-COVID. By analyzing these temporal segments, we aimed to uncover potential changes that may have occurred in response to the global pandemic. Our primary research question was to explore the relationship between the political leanings of publications and their stance on climate issues. We examined whether politically more oriented publications show a stronger bias in their climate reporting, particularly whether the context of the pandemic has influenced this. We considered various aspects such as the frequency of climate articles, the tone of coverage, and their changes over time depending on the political orientation of the newspaper. 

### Result
After investing six months into this project, we presented a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook late January 2024, detailing our hypotheses and findings, aimed at guiding readers through our data science endeavour. Currently, we are in discussions with our supervising professor about presenting our findings to our fellow students in a course.

The Jupyter Notebook can be found under this [GitHub repository link](https://github.com/za-aftab/Programming-Project).
