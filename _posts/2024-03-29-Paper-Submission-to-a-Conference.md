## LREC-COLING 2024: Paper Submission 
Last semester, I took the course “Natural Language Processing in Medicine” where we discussed the advances, challenges and future directions of NLP in medicine. The focus was on adapting NLP technology to enable clinical application such as information extraction, classification, de-identification on electronic health records, patient encounter transcripts, and other clinical narratives. 

The evaluation comprised of writing a seminar paper on a topic of our choice. The team I was part of collectively decided on introducing a novel methodology on the automatic summarisation of medical doctor-patient conversations. After doing the evaluation, our professor suggested to submit our paper to the CL4Health workshop at [LREC-COLING 2024](https://lrec-coling-2024.org/workshops-and-tutorials-at-a-glance/) as he believed sharing our findings would be beneficial. After investing significant time and energy into the refinement, we submitted our paper to LREC-COLING. We will be notified in April if the paper will be accepted - we are hoping for the best! 

(As per the submission guidelines, I can only provide access to the paper at a later date.)
