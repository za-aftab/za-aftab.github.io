I am on the verge of achieving a significant milestone - the completion my Bachelor’s degree! 
During the course of my studies I was introduced to various subfields of computational linguistics, making it challenging to decide on which area to focus my bachelor’s thesis. 
After careful consideration, I decided on an exploratory analysis of Large Language Models regarding automatic summarisations. Additional information will be provided by the end of this summer - stay tuned!
